                <p>I was born, raised and got my university education all in Columbus Ohio. Grew up on the
                    southern edge of Columbus, went to Franklin University were I got a BS in Accounting.</p>
                <p>Before my endevours in programing I worked for 5 years as a Staff Accountant at a mid-sized
                    ohio based company. It was a good experience for the time I was there but I saw that the
                    accounting feild wasn't what I wanted todo long term.</p>
